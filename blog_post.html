                    I'm currently on Day 9 of quarantine, counting the day I arrived as Day 1. This will be my first post on the blog and it feels.. momentous because I've never done something like this. However, I've felt a lot more reflective and creative after quarantine started and I hope to document what I've been feeling so I can look back on it in the future, and also to stay connected with my friends (that's you, if you're reading this). Donâ€™t expect too much though, this wonâ€™t be the most entertaining content out there and I donâ€™t plan to make it such.

                    Ideally itâ€™d be as casual as possible so that I can feel comfortable posting whenever and whatever. I find myself often losing steam on these kinds of projects, because I have a vision of what itâ€™s supposed to be and fantasizing about how baller I can make it, but then never getting anywhere because it becomes too intimidating. Iâ€™ve realized that itâ€™s more important to just do it and develop a <em>habit</em> (ðŸ˜‰) than it is to make it the best it can be. After all, Iâ€™m doing this for myself.

                    But hopefully people will read it and maybe sometimes enjoy it. Feedback and discussion will always be welcome, and Iâ€™d love it if my friends did something similar. Itâ€™s hard to stay connected when youâ€™re not in the same area, which is becoming more and more common as we get older regardless if COVID was or wasnâ€™t around.

                    Actually an idea I originally had for my blog was to make it generic and allow people to make their own profiles and customize it, with the central idea being personal expression through sharing content, whether itâ€™s long-form like this or short bites like photos/stories or yes, even memes (but only the best ones). Itâ€™d be like a hybrid baby of FB/IG/MySpace/Tumblr and it would make it okay again to post tons of photos and statuses. FB is gross because you feel like youâ€™re sharing to an auditorium of people, IG is only the highlights (bleh), I personally never had one but MySpace was dope and itâ€™d be cool to emulate itâ€™s creativity but modernize it, and Tumblr had the privacy and feels but letâ€™s stay away from all the sad boy angsty-ness of it all. Itâ€™d be nice to step away from the hustle and fast-pace of the times and slow down a little bit, donâ€™t ya think?

                    ANYWAY, so yes right now Iâ€™m in Korea sitting in a quarantine hotel. I quit my job in October after much deliberation and am taking some time off to do some exploration and self-improvement. The plan is to be in Korea until the end of January. Iâ€™m staying with Sunliâ€™s family and hope to update this blog regularly and pick up some Korean. The ultimate goal is to be able to watch K-Dramas and their associated youtube videos without subtitles. ðŸ¤¯ From there, Iâ€™ll head to Taiwan and enroll in a Mandarin language course, hopefully climbing a bunch on the side and staying busy by getting involved with various interests.

                    Soâ€¦ yeah. This is getting kind of long so Iâ€™ll stop it there, but Iâ€™m pretty excited for this blog. Let me know if thereâ€™s anything youâ€™d like to see or hear about. See ya soon.
